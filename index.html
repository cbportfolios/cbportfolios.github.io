<div id="subtitle">A simple program to illustrate how coupon rate and term to maturity affect a bond's volatility</div>
<br />
<div id="preamble" class="explanation">

Bond prices move in the opposite direction to interest rates. To identify the most volatile bonds - 
the bonds whose prices are most vulnerable to rate changes - professional 
asset managers turn to mathematical metrics such as 'modified duration'. However, this interactive graph 
lets you develop an intuition for bond volatility without having to do any maths. 

<br /><br />

To the right hand side, eight real government bonds (UK gilts) are displayed 
with their corresponding coupon rates (percentage of par value paid annually to the holder), market price, 
and remaining time until maturity. The final two bonds in the list, shaded grey, are 'virtual' or 'made-up' 
bonds that are equivalent to the final listed gilt in all but their coupon rates, which are higher. 

</div>
<table>
	<tr id="io">

	</tr>
</table>

<div class="explanation">

Portfolios made primarily of long term bonds in the list tend to be 
<a href="#" id="demo1">much more volatile.</a> The height of each bar indicates a percentage 
decrease in price for a bond given a half-percent increase in interest rates. The colour 
of the bar indicates which bond in the table is being represented; the increase in interest rate is always taken to 
be a half percent across the maturity spectrum.

<br /><br />

Gilt 8 will decrease in value by approximately 12% for a 0.5% rate-increase. Roughly that is from 
£143 to £126. It is the long time to maturity that makes for this high level of sensitivity. Using our 
virtual bonds as a comparison, we can see what that level of sensitivity would be if Gilt 8 had been issued 
with a <a href="#" id="demo2">higher coupon rate</a> (7% or 10%).

<br /><br />

Clearly, higher coupon rates mitigate some of the effects of interest rate changes. But short term bonds 
with much lower coupon rates are still <a href="#" id="demo3">much less volatile</a>. 

<br /><br />

Similar characteristics to UK gilts are reflected in other major bond markets.

<br /><br />

It is the art and science of investment management to build a portfolio that strikes 
the right balance between risk and return. This is achieved 
<a href="#" id="demo4">by combining bonds of different volatilities</a>, in different 
proportions, into portfolios that reduce the effects of rate changes on long term bonds.
