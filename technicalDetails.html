<div class="explanation">

The market values of bonds individually or as portfolios reflect the sums of the present 
values of periodic coupons and the final redemption payment (at par), discounted by prevailing 
market yields to maturity (i.e. "gross yield to maturity" or "redemption yield"). The extent 
of value changes depends on the coupon levels and maturities of each bond (itself a mini-portfolio), 
most of which can be captured by the "modified duration".

<br /><br />

Modified duration is not a perfect measure of bond-price sensitivity to interest rate 
changes. However, for small changes in rates, where a bond's cash flows don't change (the 
coupon is fixed), it can serve as a useful model for that bond's volatility.

<br /><br />

This interactive graph uses modified durations that have been precalculated 
using Excel's RATE function. This calculation can't easily be done in the JavaScript program because 
finding a bond's Yield to Maturity - a precondition for Macaulay Duration from which Modified Duration 
is calculated - requires a numerical approximation method such as Newton-Raphson as well as computation of 
some large factorials. Both of these lead to problems of 'overflow' and 'underflow'.

<br /><br />

The shading of a bar on the chart <u>does not</u> reflect proportion of the portfolio's value contributed by its bonds. 
Instead, the bar that corresponds to that portfolio is shaded to reflect the proportions of <u>price-sensitivity</u> 
contributed by each bond in the portfolio: [weighted modified duration for bond]/[portfolio's modified duration]
